# Project Name
### Food app react

### Description

A modern, responsive web application inspired by Uber Eats, built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. This project provides a user-friendly interface for browsing Food by category and price.

# Technologies Used
* React.js: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid development.

# Getting Started
### Prerequisites: Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) installed on your system. You can verify this by running node -v in your terminal.

### Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal, replacing <url> with the actual repository URL:
`git clone <url>`

# Install Dependencies:

### Using a Package Manager: If you prefer using a package manager like npm or yarn, you can follow the instructions in most online tutorials that will guide you through installation. Search online for "How to install dependencies in React project" for specific instructions.
### Manual Installation: If you don't want to use a package manager, you can manually download the required libraries from their respective websites or CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and include them in your project's HTML files. Here are links to the libraries used in this project:
  * React: https://react.dev/ (Download or follow instructions for including via CDN)
  * Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation (Download or follow instructions for including via CDN)

# Start the Development Server:

### Using a Create React App Project: If you created your project using create-react-app, you can start the development server by running: 
`yarn start` 
### Manual Setup: If you set up the project manually, you'll need to create a development server script yourself. This typically involves using a tool like webpack-dev-server. You can find tutorials online for setting up a development server for React projects.
### Open the Application: The development server will typically launch the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if specified).
